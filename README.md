# GTAMC
Open source GTA plugin for Minecraft, with no dependencies! (Developed on 1.8)

This project is free for all to use! Just don't redistribute, or claim as your own.

This is a WIP and will be updated as made.


To run:

- Download the source
- Import it into a Java IDE
- Include a spigot 1.8 library
- Add in your MySQL database information in the Core.java file (plugin requires MySQL to run)
- Export and enjoy :)
